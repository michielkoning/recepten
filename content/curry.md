# Curry

Soak the chickpeas overnight and then cook for an hour in boiling water. Drain and set aside.

Peel and roughly cube your potatoes.  

In a pot, lightly toast the fennel and cumin seeds. Add the chickpeas, potatoes, onion/shafot, garlic, turmeric, curry powder and enough oll to lightly coat. Fry very gently for a couple minutes until the potatoes have taken on the colour of the spices.

Add the tomatoes and a litle vegetable stock (you'll only need about 100ml). Season with salt, pepper and add chillies to teste. Throw in the cinnamon and star anise, and stir in the honey.

Cover and leave to simmer for 45 minutes to one hour. If you like, add a big handful of spinach a minute before serving, and stir through to wilt. Serve with plain rice and yogurt, chutney or a raita, and a wedge of lime.
